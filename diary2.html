        <h3>Dust Plague of the Builders Van</h3>
        <p>
            I bought the van from a chippy, and you could very much tell it was a builder's van. It was pretty dusty and
            tatty (not dirt, more like glue resin and paint/plaster). So the first job I decided to do was strip out the
            rear ply lining and carpet covering, then remove the headboard and completely clean the lot including the
            cab.
        </p>
        <img src=img/carpetback.jpg class="right-wrap">
        <p> This photo with the dog is the only one I have of the old carpet lining in the back before. It was very
            good for the most part and wouldn't have needed changing if it was just a work van, but nowehere near what I
            wanted for a camper (the seats weren't there originally, I just placed them there to make sure they fit).
        </p>
        <p>
            At first, I was planning on just removing a few panels to make the cleaning easier, however every panel/trim
            I seemed to remove revealed a copious amount more building dust. This made me go further and further, until
            I had completely removed the entire front dash, and even took out the seats and foot well covers, with the
            rubber flooring being the only thing left which I lifted in place to clean underneath. It became about a 5
            day process however I realised that if I didn’t do it the dust would just keep coming back and cause more
            problems, and that it would be complete peace of mind knowing you could metaphorically eat off any surface.
        </p>
        <img src=img/clean.jpg class="left-wrap">
        <p>
            The result was a very peculiar looking van, as the only thing left was the steering column and bulkhead,
            which makes a vehicle look very weird and makes you realise how everything we interact with is just a
            complete façade to make us think we know what’s going on.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, after 5 days the clean was complete and the van mostly back together again and working. The one
            thing I didn't do till I was also doing the panel repair was the rear bumper, which had been covered in a
            plaster/mastic spill, and so had to remove it to clean it as well as for the panel repair. When I did take
            it off though I had to replace a reversing sensor connection and bend the bumper-subframe straight, as it
            had evidently been bent at one point and had cut the sensor wire at the same time.
