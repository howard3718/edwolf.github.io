<h1>EdWolf van der Saar</h1>
<h3>Welcome to a website all about Howard's van, it's conversion and it's travels</h3>
<p>Hello and welcome, this website is a continuous document recording the history
of the van including it's repair and conversion work, as well any trips or voyages
it has embarked on. Mostly this is as a practice for the HTML coding skills I learnt
over lockdown so as the entire thing wasn't a complete waste of time.</p>
<p>So without firther or do, I introduce the van in it's current state</p>

<p>Having clocked up the hours working on the van over the second lockdown in November,
the front kitchen setup has come along well, however I am finding out how every little
thing is just taking a long time. For example where the edges are blended from living
space I have created to the odd curves and corners of the van or the doors. I think the
worst is probably the trasition from the cockpit in the front to the kitchen area, as
it's not easy to just hide with the speaker mesh fabric I had done elsewhere as there's
nowhere to pin it behind. It's also proving a pain because how the blind will fix across
with part of the sliding door rail in the way at the top is also a dilemma.</p>
