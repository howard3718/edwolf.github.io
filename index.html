        <h3>Welcome to a distinctly average website about an exceedingly average van and it's perpetually average
            travels
        </h3>
        <p><span class="dropcap">H</span>ello and welcome, this website is a continuous document recording the history
            of the van including its repair and conversion work, as well any trips embarked upon. Mostly this is as a
            practice for the HTML coding skills I learnt over lockdown so as the entire thing wasn't a complete waste of time.</p>
        <img src=img/parkpizza.jpg class="right-wrap">
        <p>Having clocked up the hours working on the van over the second lockdown in November, through Christmas and
            the third lockdown, it is now pretty much finished. There are a few notable things I need to finish, such as
            the doors, all of which have yet to be decorated at all.
            During November and December, the front kitchen setup came along well, however I did begin to find out how
            everything takes longer than expected. For example, there are always odd curves and corners of the van or the
            doors to try and deal with that just don't exist when you build a nice square house.
            However, the worst is probably the transition from the cockpit in the front to the kitchen area, as
            it's not easy to just hide with the speaker mesh fabric as I had done elsewhere. This is because there's
            nowhere to pin it behind in the front driving compartment. It's also proving a pain because of how the blind
            will fix across with part of the sliding door rail in the way at the top is also a dilemma.</p>

        <h2>The Van</h2>
        <p>The van is mostly finished now, lockdown 3 helped a lot with spare time to dedicate to getting it done.
            Everything in it is 95% finished, and just needs finishing touches, like magnets on the cupboard doors,
            catches on the bed drawers and gas struts on the racking doors. The seats are all finished as well, both
            rear sets have captive nut sets welded to the bottom of the van so they can be taken in and out very easily,
            with the bed held in by 7 or 8 screws as this needs to come out for the rear seats to fit in. </p>
