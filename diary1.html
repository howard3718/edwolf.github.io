        <h3>Time management</h3>
        <p>The planning stage of the project commenced essentially as soon as I'd bought the van. I had other work to do
            so I didn't allow myself to start working on the van itself until I'd finished the other stuff, and even
            though I didn't in the end, I did use some time initially to make a 3D model based on measurements of the
            van</p>

        <h3>3D Model</h3>
        <!-- 2d model viewer info at https://modelviewer.dev/, tried with .fbx format and didn't work but /glb works so just converted it online -->
        <model-viewer src="img/3dmodel.glb" alt="A 3D model of an astronaut" auto-rotate camera-controls></model-viewer>
        <p>
            This viewer doesn't fully show the features of the model, as it doesn't allow textures or for components to
            be moved within the model such as the fold out table or the slide down shelving cover above it. This is why
            the cabinet doors look green and all the woods are very odd looking. Below however is a rendered image of
            the design so you can see the intended colours and textures as well.
        </p>
        <img src="img/slidemodel.jpg" class="pan">
        <p>
            There are a few variations from this design to my final build, such as the cupboard doors no longer being
            sliding but hinged, and there being 4 but I was working around the cupboard doors I had available to me that
            I bought from eBay, and it ended up creating more room in the cupboards which was vital. Other than that
            though, everything is nearly identical as it was designed here, it was just exactly how I formed joints etc.
            so that
            fixings wouldn't show that was left to decide whilst building. There's no point modelling this as that
            definitely begins to waste your time spent in CAD just becoming overly detailed.
        </p>
        <h3>Deciding Dimensions</h3>
        <p>
            The best way I found to decide dimensions (such as the necessary chair height, the table height/length, the
            gap between the cupboards and the gap from the bed to the kitchen cabinet) is simply by sitting in
            the van with a piece of wood/cardboard propped up there. The 3D model is very useful for laying it all out
            and getting a vision in your head you can work towards as you know it all works together, but it doesn't
            help with deciding how low is too low for a sofa, or how much room you need from the seat to the roof to sit
            comfortably.
        </p>
        <h3>Design Variations</h3>
        <img src="img/foldingin.jpg" class="right-wrap">
        <p>
            There was another model I made as well with a bed that folded down instead of sliding out which you can see
            in the images to the right. It was better because it kept the seating lower so you could have a thicker
            mattress, the bed was higher so you could look out the windows at the view easier when waking up/going to
            sleep and the bedding could be put on the little ledge when the bed was folded away. It also pushed the back
            of the sofa forward and so closer to the table which would likely be an improvement.
        </p>
        <img src="img/foldingout.jpg" class="left-wrap">
        <p>
            However, it also meant that the mattress would have to be much more complicated, either with two folds or a
            fold off-centre meaning it couldn't be rotated to stop it getting lop-sided. The biggest reason though was
            simply the then limited headroom above the bed. The added complication wasn't much of an issue but in
            hindsight it definitely would have made storage under the bed a lot more complicated/impossible due to all
            the struts and moving parts.
        </p>
        <p>
            I still think the design could be good, but maybe more useful for a larger van where headroom isn't an issue
            and storage space can be worked differently.
